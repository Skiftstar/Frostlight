# What is this?

Frostlight is a Collection of AGS Widgets that might be useful for people.

I personally am developing them for my Hyprland setup, so features will be added as I need them

# Requirements

Right now, for the **Customization** tab to work, you need:
- swww
- wallust (v3)
- magick

**This will change and those won't be required once customization is out of WIP**
Commands will be editable in a config later on so you can use whatever you want

# Installation

Install [AGS](https://aylur.github.io/ags-docs/config/installation/)

Clone the Repo

Put the files in `~/.config/ags`

Run `ags` (preferrably put the command in your autostart)
