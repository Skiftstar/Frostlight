# What is this?

Frostlight is a Collection of AGS Widgets that might be useful for people.

I personally am developing them for my Hyprland setup, so features will be added as I need them

# Preview

# Requirements

**If you use the default config, you will need:**

- swww
- wallust (v3)
- magick

**These are required for the customization tab. Each command can be changed in the `config.json`** [see Configuration Notes](https://github.com/Skiftstar/Frostlight?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration)

# Installation

Install [AGS](https://aylur.github.io/ags-docs/config/installation/)

Clone the Repo

Put the files in `~/.config/ags`

Run `ags` (preferrably put the command in your autostart)

# Configuration

You can find a `config.json` file, **before making changes, stop ags**, then simply make your changes and start ags again.

This will be streamlined once the config window is complete (see Roadmap)

The wallust config is located in `style/wallust` if you want to edit how themes are generated
