# What is this?

Frostlight is a Collection of AGS Widgets that might be useful for people.

I personally am developing them for my Hyprland setup, so features will be added as I need them

# Requirements

**If you use the default config, you will need:**

- swww
- wallust (v3)
- magick

**These are required for the customization tab. Each command can be changed in the `Config Window`**

# Installation

Install [AGS](https://aylur.github.io/ags-docs/config/installation/)

Clone the Repo

Put the files in `~/.config/ags`

Run `ags` (preferrably put the command in your autostart)

# Configuration

You can edit everything in the `Config Window`

The wallust config is located in `pathToYourAGS/style/wallust` if you want to edit how themes are generated
